## Bare Minimum Features
1. multiple leaderboards (semesterly, UTA vs UTD...). Each leaderboard has its own class/spreadsheet setup.
1. the spreadsheets are the final say -- the bot is only responsible for recording raw scores onto spreadsheets and does not apply okauma or aggregate data in any way.
1. each game mode may have sub-modes (tonpuu vs hanchan)
1. use Member ID as the unique identifier. It's either the student's EID or assigned by algorithm. Discord ID, Mahjong Soul ID, etc., are all optional. Manual input necessary for someone without a Discord ID. The mechanism for assignment can be different for each sheet.
1. only certain roles can register self with certain leaderboards (e.g., UTA vs UTD)
1. whenever a game starts in a lobby, post a message with @ in the bot channel
1. **whenever a game finishes in a lobby, record it on the respective spreadsheet** and post a message in the bot channel (@silent)


## Useful Features
1. limit commands to servers (e.g., UvU-specific, with guild=env.guild etc.)
1. look up own mjsID with discord ID (default from semesterly leaderboard, option to show mjsID in another leaderboard)
1. for tournament game, allow everyone to select their own seat...
1. manually enter score with mjsID (automatically accounts for placement based on starting East). (options: East/South, fourth player optional...?) Generate UUIDs for each game. Checks for input errors (repeat usernames, non-existing usernames, summation check -- need an optional "leftover riichi sticks" option).



## Not as important Features
1. interface for everyone to manually enter their score together (a prompt for everyone to press a button for seat, and everyone entering their score simultaneously.). Generate UUIDs for each game.
1. associate mjsIDs with real names...
1. allow fixing scores by UUID for a game...
1. Pause/unpause?

## Developer TODO
1. handle exceptions like [the ones generated by `commands.is_owner()`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/api.html#discord.discord.ext.commands.on_command_error). Maybe look into [this catch-all Cog](https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/7822af90858ef65012ea500bcecf1612)
1. add privilege to admin -- more than just *the* owner.
1. automate the process of obtaining websocket endpoints (e.g., `wss://mjusgs.mahjongsoul.com:9443`)
1. check for maintenance, keep connection and reconnect when necessary

## Other TODO
1. Update Maki's server welcome message and the #rules-and-roles channel...
1. Fix `README.md` for `ms_api`:
    1. "requerements.txt"
    1. `sudo apt install protobuf-compiler` may not work; need to install the latest version manually from their [GitHub](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)
    1. reconcile the directory inconsistency in the proto update between the regular version versus the admin version
    1. updating the `.proto` files do not require the `sudo cp` step -- in fact, just supply the update scripts...
